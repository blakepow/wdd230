            <p>
                I need an app that will give accurate and detailed information
                in every country at all times. I need it to be thorough so that
                I know what temperature, humidity, and visibility each major city
                is.

                I need somthing to look at so I know where good houses to have
                parties are. I travel the country renting Airbnbs but can't afford
                a rainy day to cramp my party's style. I need to know where to rent
                depending on the weather of that town so I can party on forever.

            <p>
                A young man has a beautiful date 30 minutes,
                but he realizes they are going to see a movie at a
                drive in theater in his convertable. The roof of his
                car was recently torn off by alligators on their last date, 
                so he must act fast if a storm is coming and reschedule his 
                date, or she might send her gators after him again.

                Jerry has been looking forward to seeing his friend, Tom,
                for many moons. Tom lives a few hours away, and hates the rain.
                Jerry has been aware of this since they were young lads, and
                if it is going to rain during his stay he needs to know
                so that he can plan for a later date. Jerry is about to leave,
                and needs to know as soon as possible if it will be raining
                where Tom is.
